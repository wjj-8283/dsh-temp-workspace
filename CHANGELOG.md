All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026

### Added
- Temporary workspace for DSH web: a one-click throwaway workspace whose
  conversations are deleted at the next Harness restart (immediately or after a
  delay, optionally behind a confirm dialog).
- Pin a temp workspace to keep it permanently: files move into the folder you
  pick, the folder name becomes the workspace title, and its conversations are
  migrated (followed by a real host-level restart to re-index).
- Settings → Plugins card (`dsh-temp-workspace`) with `deleteMode`,
  `deleteDelay` and `confirmBeforeDelete`.
- npm prebuilt install (`@dsh-dev/dsh-temp-workspace`) so users get a
  one-command install that skips the `allowBuilds` build-approval step.

### Changed
- `build.mjs` gained a `--check` mode to keep the committed prebuilt
  `lib/client.js` in sync with `src/client.js`.

### Notes
- No runtime dependencies on official `@deepseek-ai/*` packages: the plugin
  receives services through the Cordis `ctx` injection, so nothing is
  duplicated inside the profile.
